        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This is the hub of resources for Kineo's internal fork of the Adapt authoring tool codebase.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section dark centre">
        <h2>Why fork?</h2>
        <p>Don't worry, we're still friends.</p>
        <p>Not every feature we develop at Kineo is suitable for the open-source project; be it unstable, or not within the scope of the open-source team's goals. These kinds of features obviously have no place in the open-source repo.</p>
        <p>We also like to develop new open-source features in a separate repo (at least to begin with), as it keeps the open-source repo a bit more focussed and clutter free. We usually push the code to the open-source repo once it's ready for testing.</p>
        <p>This being said, everything that we develop internally is stored in the repo, and is open-source and freely available to download via GitHub (and mostly importantly, it's all <em>compatible</em> with the open-source code).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section centre">
        <h2>Feedback &amp; support</h2>
        <p>We welcome any feedback you may have regarding the authoring tool. We use GitHub's issues to collate everything. This includes: bugs, feature requests and other general questions (relating to functionality).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you need support, have a look around in the <a href="https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt_authoring/wiki" target="_blank">GitHub wiki</a>; your problem may already be documented there. If you can't find what you're looking for there, please get in touch with</p>
