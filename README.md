This repository is pending deletion. It is advised that you turn around, and use the [open-source project's code](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring) instead.

This is a fork of the open-source Adapt authoring tool which has been used by Kineo as a pre-release base for testing features prior to pushing to the open-source repository.
